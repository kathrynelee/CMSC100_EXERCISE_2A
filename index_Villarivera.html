			  		I am the eldest child of Mr. and Mrs. Villarivera, residing at Lucban, Quezon. I graduated elementary in Paaralang Elementarya ng Lucban-5 where in I was the Valedictorian of the class. In highschool, I graduated from the renowned school in Southern Tagalog, Southern Luzon State University with the award of First Honorable mention and other special awards like Best in Social Studies, winning some Mathematics Quiz Bee, other Academic competition, and some Leadership awards. Passing the UPCAT was my greatest achievement so far but studying here is not a joke. I encountered so many problems that hinder me to keep going. I took a leave of absence for one acad year last AY 2013-2014 due to a knee problem. I have been maintaining medical treatment for this. I came back to school last AY 2014-2015, that time, I want to enjoy life and do what I should have done for the last year. I joined UP Banahaw, a socio-civic organization where in eventually I became the President for AY 2016-2017. I also became an active volunteer at Ugnayan ng Pahinungod-UPLB, now I am considered as a senior volunteer there. To support my study here in UPLB, I have part-time jobs. Now, all I want is to graduate and afterwards, have a stable job and then take up law in a prominent law school.

			  		Actually, I am not fond of computers. The real reason why I took the course was the scholarship offered to me. I passed the DOST Scholarship. My original course here in UPLB was BS Economics which is my first loved course. However, with the amazing world of Computer Science, I am now in love with the course and I want to finish this in order to explore it more and applied it to Economics and Law since I am planning to take them after this undergraduate course.
